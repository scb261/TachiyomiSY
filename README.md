# TachiyomiXZM
Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android 6.0 and above. **TachiyomiXZM** was created to get new fixes for **Android 5.x** based off TachiyomiSY fork. I strongly recommend using [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) or an [official fork](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/) if you have Android 6.0 or above.

## Current status
The fork will only get bug fixes from now on. See [Issues, Feature Requests and Contributing](#issues-feature-requests-and-contributing) if you have a bug.

## What was changed

* Added an option to disable 'Sync EH favorites' button from Library screen. This also removes the overflow button and you can manually update library with one tap instead of two.
* Added an option to limit number of EH gallery's versions to 3. Has edge cases with bugs.
* Some settings are defaulted to different values compared to SY.
* Animations from the bottom navigation bar are removed due to my personal preference.
* Some minor stuff that isn't supported on Android 5.x.

## Download
Get the app from the [releases page](https://github.com/scb261/TachiyomiXZM/releases). There are no preview versions.

## Issues, Feature Requests and Contributing

**Feature requests** and **Pull requests with new features** will be closed.

**Bug reports** should contain a link to the commit from upstream that fixes it, otherwise I probably won't fix it.

**Pull requests with fixes** are welcome.
