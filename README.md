# TachiyomiXZM
Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android 6.0 and above. **TachiyomiXZM** was created to get new fixes for **Android 5.x** based off TachiyomiSY fork. I strongly recommend using [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/download/) or an [official fork](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/) if you have Android 6.0 or above.

# Current status

This fork is no longer maintained. Eventually I may move it to a branch or remove entirely, so clone/download whatever you need while you have the chance.

## What was changed

* Added an option to disable 'Sync EH favorites' button from Library screen. This also removes the overflow button and you can manually update library with one tap instead of two.
* Added an option to limit number of EH gallery's versions to 3. Has edge cases with bugs.
* Some settings are defaulted to different values compared to SY.
* Animations from the bottom navigation bar are removed due to my personal preference.
* Some minor stuff that isn't supported on Android 5.x.
