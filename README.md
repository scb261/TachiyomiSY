# TachiyomiXZM
Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android 6.0 and above. **TachiyomiXZM** was created to get new fixes (and features while it's feasible) for **Android 5.x** based off TachiyomiSY fork. I strongly recommend using [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) or [a fork](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/) that is not TachiyomiXZM if you have Android 6.0 or above.

For now I will cherry-pick new commits once in a while.

## Features

Features are the same as in TachiyomiSY, but with following exceptions:
* Animations from bottom navigation bar are removed due to my personal preference.
* Dark theme is used by default.
* Option to disable 'Sync EH favorites' and overflow buttons from Library screen (one less tap to manually update library).
* Any features added after last time I cherry-picked new commits.

## Download
Get the app from [releases page](https://github.com/scb261/TachiyomiXZM/releases). There are no preview versions.

## Issues, Feature Requests and Contributing

**Feature requests** will not be implemented except features I want personally. Ask for them in Tachiyomi or TachiyomiSY, and I may or may not cherry pick it from there.

**Bug reports** are welcome, but I don't promise any fixes due to my limited knowledge in Android apps.

**Pull requests with fixes** are welcome, but it can take some time before I will merge it. Don't make PRs with new features.
